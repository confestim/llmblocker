It is too easy to fall into the "productivity" trap and it's too easy to [wait 15 seconds](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/) and then proceed to fall for it again.

How do we deal with this?


## Pi-hole
If you're running a pihole, add [`pihole-list`](pihole-list.txt) to your block list. PR if you find a new, untracked LLM. The extension automatically polls this list to determine which sites to block.

## Firefox
Pi-holes are not as wide-spread as the browser! Install the extension and challenge yourself to not disable it :).
